== Welcome to Tracks, a project by Logical Reality Design

This rails project was generated by the LRD application template generator in
the lrd_dev_tools gem. In order to work on this project with the proper LRD
tools, you will need to have the lrd_dev_tools gem cloned into a sibling
directory of this project. (Because lrd_dev_tools is proprietary, it cannot
be pulled from rubygems.org.)

From this project's directory, execute the following:
  % cd ..
  % git clone git@github.com:LRDesign/lrd_dev_tools.git

This should set up lrd_dev_tools in the correct location for you to use it with this application.

== Scaffold Generator

Please start all new controllers / scaffolds in this project with the LRD
scaffold generator. This creates controllers, views, and specs in the format
that we like them and which we have found to generate more reliable code.

== Security-critical files and credentials

Please never check any credentials (usernames, passwords, etc.) into the git
repository. To help with this praxis, the key files that contain credentials
are in .gitignore, and instead example files are provided. These include:

* config/database.yml (.example)
* config/initializers/smtp.rb (.example)
* config/initializers/secret_token.rb (.example)

== Rake Tasks

lrd_dev_tools provides a few convenient default rake tasks:

= rake db:recycle
  rebuilds both the dev and test databases from scratch.

= rake dev_setup:credentials
  (coming soon)
  copies config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml, and does the same
  with other credentialed files in config/initializers
