# An HoursReport contains a detail of the total hours worked for a project,
# including breakdown by date range and by subproject.
#
# It may be created for an entire project by passing the project to
# HoursReport.new(), and it can be filtered to show only the hours for
# a single user by passing the user as a parameter, i.e.
# HoursReport.new(@project, :user => @user)
